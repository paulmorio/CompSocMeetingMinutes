###1. Hackathons
The Security Hackathon is being run and our members managed to make this a sell out. We’re also considering sending a team to the JP Morgan hackathon.

###2. EGM
We need year reps! We currently have had three first years and a second year apply so still need to get more applications. Paul is going to make a poster advertising this and Kim is going to continue advertising this in all of her emails.

###3. STMU
This still needs sorted! Amazon is the only one that is definitely confirmed. Nantas will speak to Academics to see if any of them are interested in a spot at the STMU. Craig has suggests that Chris speaks to the start ups that are in Appleton Tower.

###4. Laser Quest
We’re going to run this event in two weeks time on the 29th October. It costs £11 per head to do this but we’re going to try and subsidise this so that it’ll only cost our members £5 each, encouraging people to actually go. This may be a high demand event so we’re going to sell tickets on a first come, first served basis. Tickets can be purchased from committee members.

###5. MetaSwitch
MetaSwitch have requested to be a sponsor and we’re going to accept this offer.

###6. Society Cards
We’ve now selected a company and have chosen Theo Scott’s design for the card. This is going to cost CompSoc £95 (plus delivery) for 250 cards. Martin is currently dealing with this and Kim has now sent him the link to the ordering page.

###7. Socials
Socials will now be every Tuesday at 8pm in Aspen. However, after this week the location will be changed to Bar50. This needs to be continuously advertised via emails and facebook, this is Kim and Craig’s responsibility.

###8. EUSA issues
There’s an issue with members applying through the box office in potterrow and not getting their membership showing up on EUSA. This needs sorted. Kim is going to email the member having the issue to find out even more details.

###9. Constitution Amendments
Craig Snowden has raised that he wishes to change parts of the constitution, this must be done at the AGM as it’s too late for us to change things in time for EGM.

###10. Other
There is still issues with the bank account and Martin is currently sorting this. The STMU for November is listed as the wrong date in the CompSoc calendar posted to Facebook, this needs changed. Craig and Jamie both have merchandise that need delivered to the CompSoc room so that they can be handed out to member. Kim needs to ensure that everyone who has signed up for membership via the EUSA website is on the mailing list for CompSoc so that no one is missing out on emails.
