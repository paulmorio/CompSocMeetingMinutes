###1. EGM
There was a problem with booking the room for the EGM so it was decided that the EGM will now be held on the same evening as the first STMU (25th Oct). Chris is going to construct an email about both the STMU and EGM to be sent out by Kim.

###2. Society cards
Competition is on Facebook and the deadline is now next Tuesday.

###3. Workshops
Chris put a poll on Facebook about which workshops people want to run e.g Intro to computing. Results next Tuesday.

###4. Website
The minutes have been put on the website and will be put there weekly. Spam users are increasing and we need a way to moderate this. Comment moderation has been added. Sponsors logos need added onto the website.

###5. SIGs
We went over the SIG documents, correcting any errors and discussing any issues. We voted to agree that these documents were correct and should be used. These documents will also be placed on the website.

###6. Hackathon
Weâ€™re going to aim to get one organised before Christmas, preferably in November time. To be discussed at a later date.
